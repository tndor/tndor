# Hi there, I'm Tudor! 👋

I'm a passionate **Cloud Engineering and AI enthusiast student at Fontys**. My focus is on designing and building scalable, secure cloud infrastructure and exploring the practical applications of artificial intelligence.

I love solving complex problems, automating workflows, and bridging the gap between modern cloud-native technologies and legacy systems.

## Featured Projects

Here are some of the key projects I've been working on:

### [Hybrid Cloud HR Platform (Case Study 3)](https://github.com/tndor/case-study-3)
**A secure, hybrid-cloud onboarding system on AWS EKS.**
This project connects a modern Python/React application with a legacy Windows Active Directory for automated user provisioning. It features a multi-layered Terraform architecture to resolve complex dependencies and implements Zero Trust security principles using network micro-segmentation and an Nginx reverse proxy.
* **Stack:** AWS EKS, Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, Python (Flask), React, Windows Server AD, Prometheus, Grafana.

### [Employee Management with SOAR (Case Study 2)](https://github.com/tndor/case-study-2)
**Containerized app with automated security response.**
An employee management application deployed on AWS using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform). It integrates a Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) capability to automatically detect and respond to security threats, such as blocking IPs after failed login attempts.
* **Stack:** AWS (ECS/Fargate, Lambda, WAF), Terraform, Docker, n8n (SOAR).

### [Arbitrage BetHelper](https://github.com/tndor/arbitrage-betting-helper)
**Automated sports betting opportunity finder.**
A Python web application that scrapes odds from multiple betting sites to highlight arbitrage opportunities. It exposes a REST API built with Connexion and includes a Flask frontend for users and administrators. Data is persisted in a SQLite database, and Selenium is used for scraping.
* **Stack:** Python, Flask, Connexion (REST API), Selenium, SQLite.

### [Simple RAG Project](https://github.com/tndor/simple-rag)
**Understanding the foundations of Retrieval-Augmented Generation.**
A minimal implementation of RAG designed to understand the core mechanics: converting text into embeddings, calculating similarity scores for retrieval, and augmenting LLM prompts with relevant context. This project focuses on the fundamentals rather than tooling or scaling.
* **Stack:** Python, Hugging Face, LLM concepts, Vector Embeddings.
